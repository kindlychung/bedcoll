12 (of 12) markers to be included from [ test.map ]
6 individuals read from [ test.ped ] 
3 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
3 cases, 0 controls and 3 missing
6 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 12 SNPs
4 founders and 2 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.777778
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 12 SNPs
After filtering, 3 cases, 0 controls and 3 missing
After filtering, 6 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
