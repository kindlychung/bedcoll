Reading map (extended format) from [ test2.bim ] 
3 markers to be included from [ test2.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ test2.fam ] 
12 individuals read from [ test2.fam ] 
6 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
6 cases, 0 controls and 6 missing
12 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ test2.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Reading alternate phenotype from [ test2.phe ] 
12 individuals with non-missing alternate phenotype
Assuming a quantitative trait
Missing phenotype value is -9
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 3 SNPs
8 founders and 4 non-founders found
3 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ test2.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 3 SNPs
After filtering, 12 individuals with non-missing status
After filtering, 12 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Converting data to Individual-major format
Writing linear model association results to [ test2.assoc.linear ]
